## Advent of Code Answers

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

It runs every year in December. You can participate and find more about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

This repo includes my answers to each programming puzzle. It is organised by year and then number of the puzzle (which correspondes to each day of December).
